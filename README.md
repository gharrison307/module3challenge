This is the third module challenge of bootcamp. Using the starter code, I added additonal code to create a random password generator. First I defined the arrays that contained the various character options (lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special). The scprit then runs through a series of prompts and confirmations for the end user to define the password character criteria and produces a random passwrod from the selected character criteria.

To use:

To generate a password, first click the "Generate Password" button.

The user will be promped to define the number of characters in the password. Enter a number between 8-128.

The user will then confirm whether to include uppercase letters. Select "OK" to include uppercase letters, select "cancel" to not include uppercase letters.

The user will then confirm whether to include lowercase letters. Select "OK" to include lowercase letters, select "cancel" to not include lowercase letters.

The user will then confirm whether to include special characters. Select "OK" to include special characters, select "cancel" to not include special characters.

The user will then confirm whether to include numbers. Select "OK" to include numbers, select "cancel" to not include numbers.

The page should then generate a password.
